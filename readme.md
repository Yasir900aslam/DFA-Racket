USAGE:
First tell the program number of states in your Machine , Including Start State 
and by default start state is set to q:0. 
Now user will enter final states , then 
name the final states , like q:1 ,q:2
When It's done User must specify the transition from one state to another .
e.g If user is in state 0 and wanted a loop in state 0 then type 0.
When machine is set.






Project Requirements :
All of the project requirements have been fulfilled. 
1- There will be 2 input variables .
2-It will ask user to test strings in user defined Machine.
4-User have defined Machine as a part of Dr Racket environment.



Different Approach and why ?
In your project requirements there was given that 'use lists' as 2D Array , for inputs , for final lists but its was tedious and hard for me differ between elements of list based upon list-ref. So , I took a different step and User C type Arrays that are used for C interfacing and that made my life a little easier.
